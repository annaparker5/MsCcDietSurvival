# MsCcDietSurvival
Experiment conducted Spring 2020, tracking Cotesia congregata survival on Manduca sexta raised on tobacco, devil's claw, and diet. 

This dataset was not used as a part of any publication; as such, the analyses are incomplete and not super thorough. However, its results regarding wasp success concur with my findings published in Ch. 2 (Leaf Scanner project). 

Data: 
- MsCcSurvDec31Final.csv: the final dataset containing all developmental data
- README_Dec31Final.csv: a README explaining all of the columns in the final dataset 

Code: 
- PrelimCleaningAnalyses.Rmd: a compilation of data cleaning, graphs, and stats to explore my findings. Focuses on caterpillar success. Well annotated. 
- WaspAnalysis.Rmd: a compilation of data cleaning, graphs, and stats to explore my findings. Focuses on wasp success. Well annotated. 

Figures: 
- A whole host of different figure iterations. All are dated with when I produced them. Most figures found embedded in the code are not exported or present here -- these mainly represent caterpillar developmental data.
