title: "Data Cleaning and Preliminary Analyses"
output: html_notebook
---

This document is where I will perform preliminary analyses to investigate my data. I will also conduct data cleaning necessary to conduct these analyses. 

Outline:

Data Cleaning:
0. Load in the data and necessary packages
1. Clean the data, eliminating those that died. 
2. Calculate necessary parameters (development time in days not dates, ln(mass))
3. Get data into long format for making cumulative growth curve graphs

Growth Analyses:
4. Run models for mass gain and development time with diet as a fixed effect, and ID within bin as random effects
5. Graph growth curves (ln-transformed) for total development
6. Plot mass and development time at wandering raw data, to map onto Geoff and I's study predictions

Wasp Analyses:
7. Run models for wasp survival to eclosion with diet and wetness as fixed effects, and ID within bin as random effects
8. Graph boxplots for eclosion percentage across diet type
